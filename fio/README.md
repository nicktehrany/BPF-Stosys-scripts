# fio

This directory contains tracing scripts for fio itself.
With these scripts you can for example trace parts of fio itself that are not traced by default.

# How to?

please alter the scripts to point to the respective fio installation.
For SPDK you need to also configure SPDK to use `--with-usdt`.
